The purpose of CBA is to compare the benefits associated to a project with the costs of implementing it. CBA represents at the same time a framework for social accounting where any benefit that can be measured and monetized is weighted against all other benefits and costs. In order to develop CBA of the project, the following steps have to be considered: 1. Identifying environmental impacts of each components of the project: this activity requires the cooperation of experts of various  disciplines and ends with the preparation of check-list of different impacts; 2. Quantifying impacts: data have to be gathered, and environmental impacts have to be measured.  3. Evaluating environmental impacts: these impacts can be subdivided in into market and non-market effects. Market effects are taken to be impacts that give rise to goods and/or services that for which values can be obtained by the observation of market prices. Non-market effects are taken to be impacts that give rise to goods/services for which no market prices are observable: valuation techniques are selected for placing a monetary value on these.  4. Creating cash flow statements: once the environmental impacts and the other cost and benefit components of the project are measured in monetary terms, the cash flow statement are created taking account of the accrual time of each monetary cost or benefit. 5. Discounting: in BCA the analyst must consider the different value of money accruing at different points of time. This aspect is taken into account by discounting the monetary flows and calculating indicators of project viability. In a CBA framework, avoided costs due to the implementation of the policy correspond to potential benefits. In this specific project, the main economic benefits derive from the reduction of microbial contamination in coastal waters. Their estimate is essentially based on the use values (benefits that derive from the actual use of the environment) and can be directly estimated and expressed in market prices (see step 3): a. A lower level of pollution will reduce the days of the bathing ban in local sea waters, which corresponds to an increase of tourism and sea water related activities and therefore of local GDP (the changes in the physical environment are valued through the changes in the productivity); b. A lower level of contamination of the waters translates in improved general health of citizens, i.e. avoided costs of health care and hospitalization due to infection and related diseases.  A recent work (Rombaldoni et al. 2009)  within a team of different experts (economists, mathematicians and biologists) was relative to the economic  valuation of the Marine Protected Areas, as a tool for a sustainable fisheries management,  in the Adriatic Sea (that of Fossa di Pomo, in the south-east of Italy), through the individuation of the related costs and benefits. The main benefits were environmental, but also complementary benefits were considered, such as effects on tourism and other correlated activities (among which sea exploration and biodiversity conservation).
